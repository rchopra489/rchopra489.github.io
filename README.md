This is my first small project in my web development journey.

I used CSS and HTML to replicate a webpage as identical as possible.
You can checkout my website here :- https://rchopra489.github.io/product.html

Note:- It is a part of freecodecamp.org 's projects.

Added a technical documentation page as a part of freecodecamp.org projects
visit it here:- https://rchopra489.github.io/doc.html


Added page.html which is a part of theodinproject.com's first mini project
Note :-  This page is not responsive nor it is well structured as i am a newbie but decided to post it anyway.
